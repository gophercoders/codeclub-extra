## GopherCoders.com Code Club Extra Programs

A random collection of extra or alternative programs used in the GopherCoders.com
code clubs.

* orbits
* any-orbit

Each program introduces a specific concept.

Unless otherwise stated, the programs are incomplete and will not work until
the pupils complete them.

* orbits - calculates the speed of ISS, Hubble Space Telescope, the Astra 1KR
satellite and a GPS satellite in orbit. It is used to introduce number variables and maths go.

* any-orbit - a generalised version of the orbit program. It calculates the speed in
orbit of any satellite.

* rune-conter - Counts the number of runes in a message then prints a different
message depending on the number of runes. Used to introduce is-else statements.

* rune-printer - Introduces the concept of runes. It shows how to convert a string
to a slice of runes, how to access an individual rune and how to convert a rune
back to a string for easy printing.

* worldtemperature - compares the temperature the user types in to a number of
cities around the world. Used to introduce if statements.

* pong-v1 - a skeleton to be used as a starting point for Pong. The functions for the
main game loop need to be added.

* pong-v2 - Revised Pong skeleton, using the toolbox package. This version uses
the github.com/gophercoders/toolbox package to move the nitty gritty of the
graphics key and window handling from the main code. This results is much simpler
code skeleton, which can then be filled with the game logic.
